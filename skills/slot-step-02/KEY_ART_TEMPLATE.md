<theme_summary>, <style_lock>, a single hero subject as the dominant focal point,

separation, spotlight composition with a calmer cleaner center and edge detail
carrying story, upper-left key light at 10 o'clock, <palette_leads.primary>
palette with <palette_leads.accents> accents, corners 20 to 40 percent darker
than center for a soft vignette, no UI mockup, no reels, no paylines, no spin
buttons, no HUD, no text, hero face or figure occupies roughly the center
60 to 70 percent of the composition, professional slot game art,

## Rules

- **One visual idea.** Single hero focal point. No ensemble unless that IS the theme.
- **Hero occupies 60–70%** of the composition for character-centric comps.
- **Three-layer composition:** foreground framing → midground story → distant sky.
- **Spotlight composition:** calmer cleaner center; edge detail carries story.
- **Vignette:** corners 20–40% darker than center.
- **No UI inside key art.** No reels, paylines, spin buttons, HUD.
- **Master at 4K.** Crop derivatives from same master (or use nb2_smart_resize).
- **Anchor the hero.** Name and describe the hero explicitly — do not let NB2 invent one.

## After approving the master

Write the approved file path back to `game_brief.json` → `key_art_path`.
Every downstream skill (slot-step-03, slot-step-05,
slot-step-06) reads `style_anchor.key_art_path` from `project.json`
and passes the image to NB2 as a reference to lock the visual identity.
