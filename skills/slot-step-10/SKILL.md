description: STEP 10 (final) — Produce pixel-perfect multi-aspect variants of an approved asset (e.g., generate 1:1, 16:9, and 9:16 versions of a hero asset). Outputs are named `<source>_resize_<W>_<H>.png` showing the exact target dimensions, and they live in the same category folder as the source. Either Gemini or fal.ai works fully for this; when both keys are set the plugin routes to fal.ai's purpose-built nano-banana-pro endpoint (single API call) over Gemini's NB2 + center-crop path. For single-aspect upscale use /slot-step-09.

# Step 10 — Smart Resize (final delivery)

Generates multi-aspect-ratio variants from one source asset. Unlike a
crop, smart-resize **recomposes** the subject for each target — useful
for marketing crops, lobby thumbnails, ad variants.

## Backends — which one runs depends on which key is set

This skill uses `nb2_smart_resize`. The underlying backend is picked
automatically based on which API key is set:

| Keys present | Backend | Underlying model | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FAL_KEY` (with or without Gemini) | fal.ai | **nano-banana-pro** | Single API call, purpose-built endpoint. Preferred. |
| Only `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini | **gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview** (NB2) | One Gemini call per target + pngjs center-crop locally. |

Both backends produce pixel-perfect output at the requested dimensions.
The recipe is the same idea — generate at the smallest preset that
fully covers the target, then center-crop to the exact W×H — but the
fal.ai version does it as one server-side call, while the Gemini
version does it client-side here in Node (using pngjs for the crop,
no native deps).

**Note on gpt-image-2 and resize:** a `gpt2_smart_resize` tool was
prototyped in earlier 1.5.x releases but was removed in v1.5.3 — its
output quality wasn't verified against the well-tested fal.ai path,
so it didn't meet the "only ship skills that work" bar. For text-heavy
sources where wordmark preservation across aspect ratios matters,
the documented path is: generate the new aspect ratio fresh at 2K with
`gpt2_generate` and a recompose prompt, OR run `nb2_smart_resize` and
accept that text may need to be re-composited at runtime.

## Startup protocol

Follow `shared/project_memory.md` → "Skill startup protocol", including
the "no active project — guide through setup" pattern.

1. Resolve active project. **If none exists**, the user is asking to
   resize something that hasn't been generated — route to
   `/slot-step-01` to set up a project, then explain that there's
   nothing approved yet to resize. Suggest the relevant design skill
   so the user can build up the source asset, then return here for
   the multi-aspect variants.
2. Load `project.json`.
3. Detect available API key(s):
   - If `FAL_KEY` is set → fal.ai backend
   - Else if `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set → Gemini backend
   - Else → route the user to `/slot-setup` (or have them run
     `setup-keys.js`) to configure at least one key. The resize work
     can resume once a key is in place.
4. Identify the source asset to resize. Typically the locked key art
   for marketing crops, or an approved hero symbol for lobby/banner
   variants. If nothing approved exists yet, route to the relevant
   design skill — don't fabricate a source.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Pick source and targets

Source: any approved image in the project folder.

**If the user pastes / attaches an external asset in chat** that they want
resized to multiple aspects, that path lives in a temp location outside
the allowed-roots envelope — `nb2_smart_resize` will reject it. Stage it
first:

```
nb2_stage_image({ source: "<chat-temp-path>", label: "user_resize_source" })
  → ~/.h5g-slot-art-creator/inputs/user_resize_source_NNN.png
```

Pass the staged path as `source` to `nb2_smart_resize` in Step 4. See
`shared/chat_image_staging.md` for full details.

Targets: list of `{aspect_ratio, label}` pairs. Common combinations:

| Use case | Targets |
|---|---|
| Marketing trio | `[{1:1, "square"}, {16:9, "wide"}, {9:16, "tall"}]` |
| Lobby + banner | `[{1:1, "tile"}, {16:9, "banner"}]` |
| Mobile portrait + landscape | `[{9:16, "portrait"}, {16:9, "landscape"}]` |

### Step 2 — Build the prompt

Smart-resize uses a short recomposition prompt:

```
Recompose this image at the new aspect ratio while preserving the subject,
palette, style, and overall mood. Adjust framing and composition as needed
to fit the target shape. Do not crop awkwardly; recompose intelligently.
Keep the hero subject as the focal point.
```

If the source is key art with specific composition rules (vignette,
three-layer depth, hero centered), restate them so smart-resize preserves
the design intent at every target ratio.

### Step 3 — Pre-generation validation

- [ ] Source path exists
- [ ] At least one target aspect ratio specified
- [ ] All target ratios are valid NB2 ratios
- [ ] No hex / resolution strings in prompt body
- [ ] At least one of `FAL_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set

### Step 4 — Generate

Call `mcp__nb2node__nb2_smart_resize`:

| API arg | Value |
|---|---|
| `prompt` | composed recomposition prompt |
| `source` | absolute path to the source asset — resolve `style_anchor.key_art_path` (or whichever asset relative path) against `project_root` first (`path.join(project_root, stored)`) |
| `target_sizes` | array of `"WxH"` strings — explicit pixel dimensions for each target, e.g. `["2048x2048", "3840x2160", "2160x3840"]` for a marketing trio. The MCP tool appends each `WxH` to the output filename in the `_resize_<W>_<H>` form. |
| `output_dir` | **the source's category folder** — `path.dirname(absolute_source_path)`. Resized variants live next to their source so `Key_Art/Key_Art_003.png` and `Key_Art/Key_Art_003_resize_2048_2048.png` sit side by side. |
| `asset_name` | **the source basename without extension** — for source `Key_Art_003.png` pass `"Key_Art_003"`. The MCP server adds the `_resize_<W>_<H>` suffix per target. Do NOT include the suffix yourself; the server adds it. Do NOT pass the full filename with `.png` — `sanitizeAssetName` strips it. |

The MCP tool returns one output file per target. Naming pattern is
`{asset_name}_resize_<W>_<H>.png` where `<W>_<H>` is the exact target
dimensions in pixels — e.g. for `asset_name = "Key_Art_003"` with
target `"2048x2048"` the output is `Key_Art_003_resize_2048_2048.png`.
The older `_<W>x<H>` and `_resized_<aspect>` suffix forms are
**retired** in v1.5.4 — new generations always carry the `_resize_`
prefix plus exact pixel dimensions so a designer can read the size
off the filename without opening the file, and so the `x` in
upscale-multiplier suffixes (`_upscl_x2`) can't be confused with the
`x` in old resize-dimensions suffixes.

### Step 5 — Inline review

Read each output. Confirm:
- Subject preserved at each ratio
- Palette consistent across all variants
- No awkward crops or stretched elements
- Composition reads correctly at each aspect (focal point still focal)

If a variant fails, regenerate just that one with adjusted prompt
emphasizing the failure point.

### Step 6 — Update state

Append each variant to the appropriate slot's `resized` array as
`{aspect, dimensions, path}` entries. Paths are project-relative
including the subfolder. Examples:

```json
"assets.key.resized": [
  {"aspect": "1:1",  "dimensions": "2048x2048", "path": "Key_Art/Key_Art_003_resize_2048_2048.png"},
  {"aspect": "16:9", "dimensions": "3840x2160", "path": "Key_Art/Key_Art_003_resize_3840_2160.png"}
]
"assets.backgrounds.base.resized": [
  {"aspect": "16:9", "dimensions": "3840x2160", "path": "Backgrounds/BG_base_001_resize_3840_2160.png"}
]
```

Set `current_step: "delivery_complete"`, `next_step: null` (project done)
or `"/slot-step-08"` to re-audit the final delivery.

Schema follows the canonical asset record shape.

### Step 7 — Next step nudge

```
✓ Step 10 — Smart Resize complete.
  Source : Key_Art/Key_Art_003.png
  Folder : <project_root>/Key_Art/
  Open   : file:///<project_root>/Key_Art/
  Variants:
    - Key_Art/Key_Art_003_resize_2048_2048.png   (1:1 square — lobby tile)
    - Key_Art/Key_Art_003_resize_3840_2160.png   (16:9 wide — web banner)
    - Key_Art/Key_Art_003_resize_2160_3840.png   (9:16 tall — mobile loading screen)

Project complete. All assets organized by category under:
  <project_root>/

To audit final delivery: `/slot-step-08`
To start a new game: `/slot-step-00` or `/slot-step-01`

Type `/slot-` to see the full numbered workflow.
```

## Hard rules

- **Either backend works.** fal.ai is preferred (single API call to a
  purpose-built endpoint). Gemini fallback runs locally — one Gemini call
  per target plus a pngjs center-crop. Both produce pixel-perfect output.
- Hard fail cleanly only if BOTH `FAL_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` are missing.
- **Source preserved.** Original asset stays untouched; resizes are new files.
- **Per-aspect inline review.** Check each variant individually.
