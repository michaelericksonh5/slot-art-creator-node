description: STEP 6 — Generate slot machine UI surfaces and in-game characters — reel frames/bezels, HUD chrome, paytable, win banners (small/medium/big/mega/epic), bonus screens (free-spins/pick-me/wheel intros), multiplier badges, lobby tiles, logos (hero/standard/compact lockups), spin/bet buttons, control panels, and in-game animated avatars (the player-facing characters that react to wins — 0 to 5 per game). Reads the locked key art, symbol sheet, and background as references so every surface and character lives in the same world. UI must always rank below symbols in visual hierarchy; avatars sit alongside the reels and follow character-design discipline. Run after /slot-step-05. Use this skill whenever the user asks to generate any chrome surface OR an in-game avatar / mascot / animated character.

# Step 6 — UI Designer

UI chrome is infrastructure. It must reinforce the theme without stealing
attention from the symbols or the win moments. The reel is always the hero.
Every UI surface generated here is anchored to the locked key art, the
approved symbols, and the approved background.

## Startup protocol

1. Resolve active project
2. Load `project.json`, `game_brief.json`
3. Read references in priority order:
   - `style_anchor.key_art_path` (required)
   - Approved symbol sheet (if available)
   - Approved base background (if available)
4. If key art isn't locked, stop and tell user to run `/slot-step-02` first

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Pick the surface

Ask if not specified. Each surface has a dedicated category folder so
chrome doesn't get mixed with avatars and avatars don't get mixed with
banners — a designer reviewing one surface type opens one folder.

| Surface | Folder | Filename pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `bezel` (reel frame) | `Bezels/` | `Bezel_NNN.png` |
| `hud` (spin button + balance/bet) | `HUD/` | `HUD_NNN.png` |
| `paytable` | `Paytables/` | `Paytable_NNN.png` |
| `banner_<tier>` (win banners by tier) | `Win_Banners/` | `Banner_small_NNN.png`, `Banner_big_NNN.png`, etc. |
| `bonus_screen` (free spins / pick-me / wheel intro) | `Bonus_Screens/` | `BonusScreen_<variant>_NNN.png` |
| `multiplier_xN` | `Multipliers/` | `Multiplier_x2_NNN.png`, `Multiplier_x10_NNN.png` |
| `lobby_tile` | `Lobby_Tiles/` | `Tile_NNN.png` |
| `logo_<lockup>` | `Logos/` | `Logo_hero_NNN.png`, `Logo_standard_NNN.png`, `Logo_compact_NNN.png` |
| `avatar_<id>` (in-game animated character) | `Avatars/` | `Avatar1_NNN.png` through `Avatar5_NNN.png` (up to 5 per game; many games have zero) |

### Step 2 — Build the prompt (READ the right surface template)

This skill uses **progressive disclosure** — the per-surface prompt
formulas live in dedicated companion files. Read ONLY the file for the
surface you're generating. Don't read all of them.

| Surface being generated | Read this file FIRST |
|---|---|
| `bezel` (reel frame) | `BEZEL_TEMPLATE.md` |
| `hud` | `HUD_TEMPLATE.md` |
| `banner_<tier>` (any tier — small/big/mega/epic) | `BANNERS_TEMPLATE.md` |
| `bonus_screen` (free-spins / pick-me / wheel) | `BONUS_SCREEN_TEMPLATE.md` |
| `multiplier_xN` | `MULTIPLIER_TEMPLATE.md` |
| `lobby_tile` | `LOBBY_TILE_TEMPLATE.md` |
| `logo_<lockup>` (hero / standard / compact) | `LOGO_TEMPLATE.md` |
| `paytable` | `PAYTABLE_TEMPLATE.md` |
| `avatar_<id>` (in-game character) | `AVATAR_TEMPLATE.md` |

Each template file contains:
- Surface rules (palette, sizing, conventions)
- Prompt formula(s) with substitution markers
- Pre-gen quick checks specific to that surface
- Post-gen quick checks specific to that surface

If the user asks for "all UI surfaces" or "the full UI set," generate them
in this order so each can reference the prior approved chrome:

1. `bezel` — sets the metallic/palette baseline for chrome
2. `hud` — fits below the bezel
3. `banners` — escalation series (small → big → mega → epic)
4. `bonus_screen` variants — free-spins, pick-me, wheel
5. `multipliers` — denomination series
6. `paytable` — composes from approved symbols
7. `lobby_tile` — marketing surface (often last)
8. `logo` lockups — often a parallel track to gameplay UI

### Step 3 — Pre-generation validation (Gate 1)

**Universal:**
- [ ] `style_lock` in prompt verbatim
- [ ] No hex / resolution / aspect ratio strings in prompt body

**UI hierarchy:**
- [ ] Prompt does NOT instruct chrome to be the brightest/dominant element
- [ ] For bezel: "reel is the hero" stated
- [ ] For banners: numeral stated as focal point
- [ ] Palette drawn from brief but kept secondary to symbols

**Surface-specific:**
- [ ] Grid dimensions stated for bezel
- [ ] Touch target sizes stated for HUD/pick-me
- [ ] Tier count and tier differences stated for banners

### Step 4 — Generate

**Pick the right tool first AND the right folder.** Every surface has
two routing decisions — which MCP tool to call, and which subfolder the
output lands in. Both are surface-determined:

| Surface | `output_dir` (subfolder of `project_root`) | Has visible required text? | Preferred tool (if `OPENAI_API_KEY` set) | Fallback (NB2-only) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `paytable` | `Paytables/` | yes (PAY TABLE header, pay values) | `gpt2_generate` | `nb2_generate` |
| `logo_<lockup>` | `Logos/` | yes (the wordmark spelling matters) | `gpt2_generate` | `nb2_generate` |
| `banner_<tier>` | `Win_Banners/` | usually no (composited at runtime) | `nb2_generate` (or `gpt2_edit` for runtime-baked labels) | `nb2_generate` |
| `bezel` | `Bezels/` | no | `nb2_generate` | `nb2_generate` |
| `hud` | `HUD/` | no | `nb2_generate` | `nb2_generate` |
| `bonus_screen` | `Bonus_Screens/` | no | `nb2_generate` | `nb2_generate` |
| `multiplier_xN` | `Multipliers/` | no | `nb2_generate` | `nb2_generate` |
| `lobby_tile` | `Lobby_Tiles/` | no (title appears at runtime) | `nb2_generate` | `nb2_generate` |
| `avatar_<id>` | `Avatars/` | no | `nb2_generate` | `nb2_generate` |

`gpt2_generate` accepts the same `output_dir` / `asset_name` shape as
`nb2_generate`. Keep `image_size: "2K"` for gpt2 even on hero lockups —
its 4K targets are experimental and unreliable for production; upscale
the approved 2K result with `nb2_upscale` if you need 4K marketing
output. See `shared/gpt_image2_prompting.md` for the full routing table.

**API args (NB2 path — most surfaces):**

| API arg | Value |
|---|---|
| `prompt` | composed prompt |
| `aspect_ratio` | match surface — bezel: game orientation, banner: portrait, tile: `1:1` or `4:3`, avatar: `1:1` |
| `image_size` | `"2K"` default |
| `output_dir` | `path.join(project_root, "<Folder>")` where `<Folder>` is the subfolder from the routing table above (e.g. `Bezels`, `HUD`, `Win_Banners`, `Avatars`). Folder is created on first write. |
| `asset_name` | the surface label, e.g. `"Bezel"`, `"HUD"`, `"Banner_big"`, `"Logo_hero"`, `"Avatar1"` (the MCP server appends `_NNN.png` and auto-increments by scanning the target folder for existing files with that prefix) |
| `references` | absolute paths — resolve `style_anchor.key_art_path`, `assets.sheet.approved`, and `assets.backgrounds.base.approved` against `project_root` first (`path.join(project_root, stored_relative_path)`), then pass the resolved absolutes. Filter null/undefined entries. |

**API args (gpt2 path — paytable, logos, or anything text-heavy):**

| API arg | Value |
|---|---|
| `prompt` | composed prompt (gpt-image-2 reasons better when the structural intent — row count, label positions, wordmark spelling — is stated explicitly) |
| `aspect_ratio` | match surface |
| `image_size` | `"2K"` (the stable production ceiling) |
| `quality` | `"high"` for hero / marketing surfaces |
| `output_dir` | `path.join(project_root, "Paytables")` or `path.join(project_root, "Logos")` — same per-surface routing as the NB2 path. |
| `asset_name` | same convention as NB2 |
| `extra_references` (gpt2_edit only) | absolute paths to approved symbol PNGs when composing them into a layout |

### Step 5 — Inline QA check (Gate 2)

**BLOCK** (auto-iterate):
- UI brighter/more dominant than symbols
- Bezel has opaque center (would cover reels)
- Banner numeral isn't the focal point
- Style doesn't match key art

**FLAG**:
- Chrome feels too busy
- Touch targets look small
- Palette slightly off from the symbol set

**PASS:** confirm and continue.

### Step 6 — Update state

All paths stored in `project.json` are relative to `project_root` and
include the subfolder, e.g. `"Bezels/Bezel_001.png"`,
`"Win_Banners/Banner_big_001.png"`, `"Avatars/Avatar1_002.png"`.

For surfaces with a flat slot (`bezel`, `hud`, `paytable`, `bonus_screen`,
`lobby_tile`):
- Append the relative path to `project.json.assets.ui.<surface>.iterations`
- If user approves, set `project.json.assets.ui.<surface>.approved` to
  that same relative path

For nested groups (`banners.<tier>`, `multipliers.<denom>`, `logos.<lockup>`):
- Append the relative path to `project.json.assets.ui.banners.<tier>.iterations`
  (etc.)
- If user approves, set `.approved` on the nested record

For **avatars** (the in-game character family):
- Append the relative path to `project.json.assets.avatars.<AvatarN>.iterations`
  where `<AvatarN>` is `Avatar1` through `Avatar5`
- If user approves, set `project.json.assets.avatars.<AvatarN>.approved`
  to that same relative path
- The `assets.avatars` object is created in the schema even when a game
  has zero avatars — slots stay at `{iterations: [], approved: null}`
  until something lands

Set `current_step: "ui_in_progress"`, `next_step: "/slot-step-06"`
(continue) or `"/slot-step-08"` (move to audit).

Schema for every UI and avatar slot follows the canonical asset record
shape in `shared/project_memory.md`.

### Step 7 — Next step nudge

```
✓ Step 6 — Bezel generated.
  File: Bezels/Bezel_001.png
  Reel is the hero, frame transparent center ✓
  Folder: <project_root>/Bezels/
  Open:   file:///<project_root>/Bezels/

Next options:
  - Generate other UI surfaces (HUD, paytable, banners, logos) with /slot-06 again
  - Generate in-game avatars with /slot-06 (avatar_1, avatar_2, ...)
  - Run `/slot-step-07` if reskinning an existing UI mock
  - Run `/slot-step-08` for full set audit

Type `/slot-` to see the full numbered workflow.
```

## Hard rules

- **Reel is always the hero.** Chrome ranks below symbols in brightness and weight.
- **No raw pixel counts** in prompts — semantic size terms only.
- **Win-banner tiers must differ in at least 2 dimensions.**
- **Three logo lockups** when generating a logo.
