description: STEP 1 — Lock the game brief (theme, palette, style, tier plan, symbol manifest) into project.json. This is the foundation every later skill reads. Run after /slot-step-00 (if you have a GDD) or as the first step if pitching a fresh concept. Always run before /slot-step-02. Use when the user describes a game theme, pitches a concept ("let's make a [X] game", "I want a [theme] slot"), discusses what symbols to include, or wants to set up or update the game brief. Also use when continuing a project that has a GDD loaded but no art direction locked yet — apply the user's theme description to the existing active project, never start a new one.

# Step 1 — Game Brief

This is the foundation of every project. The brief locks theme, palette,
style, tier structure, and the full symbol manifest. The brief captures
**design intent**; at lock time it's mirrored into `project.json`,
which is the **runtime canonical state** every other skill (02 through
10) reads. When the two ever disagree, `project.json` wins — see
`GAME_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md` for the full contract. Getting the brief
right here is cheap; getting it wrong is expensive because every
downstream skill inherits the locked values via `project.json`.

## Startup protocol

Follow the standard startup from `shared/project_memory.md`:

1. **Resolve project.** Did the user pass a GameID arg? Use it. Otherwise
   read `~/.h5g-slot-active-project.json`. If neither exists, ask the user
   for a GameID and create the project folder. **Never ask for a GameID
   when an active-project pointer already exists** — that pointer
   establishes the project; use it.
2. **Construct project root.** Resolve `<PROJECT_BASE>` per
   `shared/project_memory.md` (env var → H5G Drive Stream → `~/slot-art-projects/`),
   then join `<PROJECT_BASE>/{GameID}_{username}/`. `username` comes from
   `os.userInfo().username` — never hardcoded.
3. **Load existing state.** If `project.json` exists, use the active
   project — do not propose a new one or ask for a new GameID. Read the
   existing brief and style anchor. When `current_step` is `gdd_loaded`
   (a GDD was extracted but art direction hasn't been locked yet), art
   fields like `theme_summary`, `palette`, `style_lock`, and all symbol
   `subject` fields will be null — that's the expected state for a pure
   engineering GDD with no art direction.

   **Critical: `game_name` from a GDD is always a preproduction codename
   — never a visual theme.** H5G games are developed under internal
   codenames (like "Tesla", "Chevy", "Blazing Stampede") that have zero
   relationship to the actual art direction. "Tesla" is not about cars.
   "Chevy" is not about trucks. The codename is just a project identifier.
   Never look at `game_name` and infer anything about what the game looks
   like, what the symbols are, or what the theme is. The visual theme
   comes exclusively from: (1) the user's description, or (2) explicit art
   direction sections in the GDD.

   When the active brief has null art fields and the user describes a
   visual theme, confirm the connection before applying it — don't silently
   decide it's a different game just because the codename and theme don't
   match:

   > "You have an active project — **Game [ID] ([game_name])** — with a GDD
   > loaded but no visual theme set yet. I'm going to apply your theme to
   > this project. Quick check: are you designing the art direction for
   > game [ID], or did you want to start a completely separate project?"

   Always ask for the real player-facing title when locking the brief —
   the codename must never appear in any prompt, style anchor, or
   creative-facing output. This is unconditional: even if `open_questions`
   doesn't flag it, the `game_name` from a GDD needs confirmation.

   If `project.json` doesn't exist, create from scratch (or seed from
   `/slot-step-00` output).

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Determine inputs

Either the user has a GDD (run `/slot-step-00` first if so), or they
have a pitch. Ask once for whichever is missing.

### Step 2 — Lock the brief fields

Required fields (full schema in `GAME_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md`):

- `game_name` — the real player-facing title confirmed by the user. H5G
  GDDs always use internal preproduction codenames (e.g. "Tesla", "Chevy")
  that have no relationship to the game's visual theme or subject matter.
  Always ask the user "What's the player-facing title for this game?" when
  locking the brief. Never use the GDD's `game_name` as the final title
  without explicit confirmation.
- `mood` — 1–2 words
- `theme_summary` — ≤ 2 sentences
- `style_lock` — exactly one phrase from `shared/nb2_prompting.md` §9.4
- `palette_leads` — `primary`, `accents`, `forbidden_on_lp` (named colors only, no hex)
- `grid` — e.g. `"5x4"`
- `tier_plan` — canonical baseline: 3 specials + 2 HP + 2 MP + 5–6 LP.
  One LP family. Modern feature-rich games (Loot Link, Hold-and-Spin,
  Billionaire's series) ship 20–45 symbols including WYS/SF
  feature-token families — don't force them down to 13.
- `wild` — what it IS, how it BREAKS the theme
- `scatter` — label and shape (or note that the game uses a `WY` symbol with the scatter role from the WYS family)
- `jackpot_tier_names` — when the game has jackpot symbols, set this
  explicit mapping (`{"JP1": "Grand", "JP2": "Major", "JP3": "Minor",
  "JP4": "Mini"}` for the most common modern ordering — but check the
  GDD; 9 of 11 catalog games use JP1=Grand but a few use JP1=Mini)
- `symbol_manifest` — full schema `{id, tier, family, subject, role,
  mechanic, notes}` for every symbol the game ships. **Walk every
  symbol** including the WYS / SF families, the jackpot tiers, and
  any compound prefixes (BWY, WJP, etc.) — see Step 2b below
- `mode_list` — `["base", "free spins", "bonus pick-me", "wheel", ...]`
- `rtp` — informational only

### Step 2b — Walk the full symbol manifest

The catalog of 26 shipped H5G games shows modern feature games carry
**20–45 distinct symbols** including extensive WYS / SF feature
families and compound prefixes. Don't shortcut the manifest to just
HP/MP/LP/Wild/Scatter — that misses the actual production complexity.

When the user has a GDD, the manifest comes from `/slot-step-00`'s
GDD extraction (which maps GDD prose into the family + mechanic
fields). When the user is pitching fresh without a GDD, walk them
through every family the game uses:

1. **Pay tiers (always)** — HP1/HP2 (2 high-pay characters or iconic
   objects), MP1/MP2 (2 mid-pay objects), LP1–LP6 (5–6 low-pay; ask
   whether card royals, themed objects, gems, or suits).
2. **Wild (almost always)** — WD1 standard, plus any variants (WD2
   sticky, WD3 expanding, etc.). For each variant, capture the
   `mechanic` (sticky / stacked / expanding / walking / respin /
   transforming / multiplier / duplicating / scatter-wild-hybrid).
3. **Scatter / Bonus** — either a legacy `SC` symbol OR a `WY`
   symbol with `mechanic: scatter` (newer H5G pattern). Plus
   optionally a `BO` symbol if the game has a separate bonus
   trigger.
4. **WYS family (most modern feature games)** — Ask: "Does the game
   have coins, portals, or spherical feature tokens?" If yes, walk
   every `WY<N>` / `WYS<N>` the GDD specifies. For each, capture
   the role (hold-and-spin coin, WYSIWYG collector, scatter, random-
   wilds shooter, collector+multiplier, adder, HP-equivalent payout,
   Loot Link trigger). The catalog shows games ship 1–9 WYS symbols.
5. **SF family (Loot Link / Hotspot / Mystery games)** — Ask: "Does
   the game have hotspot multipliers, collectors, path-formers, or
   mystery symbols?" If yes, walk every `SF<N>` and capture the role
   (mystery transform / hotspot multiplier or adder or combiner or
   collapse or persist / upgradable collector / immediate-payout
   collector / bonus value collector / transforming collector /
   path-forming prize / lock-and-respin / jackpot coin / bonus-game
   trigger).
6. **Jackpot tiers (when present)** — Walk JP1 through JP4 (or
   JP1–JP6 for 6-tier games). Explicitly set
   `brief.jackpot_tier_names` BEFORE filling the manifest entries
   so the tier labels are consistent. Default to JP1=Grand for newer
   games unless the GDD says otherwise.
7. **Loot Link family (when the game has Loot Link / Hotspot
   mechanics)** — Either via the canonical COL / ACT / HOT_*
   prefixes OR via generic SF / WY / BWY labels (the catalog shows
   real GDDs use both). Capture the mechanic per symbol.
8. **Blocker (cluster/grid-clear games)** — BL standalone, OR BL1
   and BL2 if the game uses mode-specific blockers or damage-tier
   blockers.
9. **Pay multipliers (when present)** — D2_HP1, D3_HP1, SPLIT_HP1,
   MULT_x10, DHP1 (H5G alias for D2_HP1), etc.
10. **Pachinko / Drop Zone (when the game is pachinko-style)** —
    BALL, PEG, BUCKET_x100, etc.
11. **Compound prefixes (modern combo games)** — BWY (bonus+WYS),
    WJP (wild+jackpot), WDWY (wild+WYS scatter-wild hybrid), WDSF
    (wild+SF), MUWD (multiplier wild), MUWDBO (multiplier wild +
    bonus), SFWY (SF+WYS). When the GDD describes a symbol that
    does two things, use a compound prefix rather than a single
    primitive — the visual will reflect both roles.
12. **Replacement (R1+)** — only if the GDD calls it out.

Full prefix vocabulary + family routing lives in
`shared/symbol_vocabulary.md`. The manifest's `mechanic` field is
what the art skills later read to pick the right template overlay,
so capture it specifically (don't write "TBD" — ask the user instead).

### Step 3 — Build the Style Anchor

Construct a single ~60–90-word block of game-wide discipline that will
be prepended verbatim to every future NB2 prompt (see
`shared/nb2_prompting.md` §9.2.1). Fill the template with this brief's
values:

```
You are generating art assets for a mobile slot machine game ("<game_name>"
— <theme_summary>). Every output must be optimized for small phone
screens — every element must be recognizable by silhouette alone when
small on a phone. Use bold, clean shapes — no intricate micro-textures,
no dense filigree that collapses at thumbnail size. High contrast between
foreground and the flat background. Warm saturated colors signal high
pay; cool muted colors signal low pay. Gold is reserved for premium and
special symbols only. Maintain a consistent <style_lock> rendering
technique across the entire set.
```

Save the filled-in string to **`project.json.style_anchor.text`** — this
is the canonical location every downstream skill reads (see the field
contract in `shared/project_memory.md` → "`style_anchor` field contract").
Mirror the same string to `game_brief.json.style_anchor` for human
readability when the brief is reviewed standalone, but treat
`project.json.style_anchor.text` as the source of truth. Do NOT write it
under `project.json.brief` — that field holds the structured brief
(theme, palette, manifest…), not the style anchor.

### Step 4 — Confirm with user

Show the brief AND the style anchor, ask for sign-off. Get explicit
"lock it" before writing.

### Step 5 — Persist

Atomic-write to BOTH:
- `{project_root}/game_brief.json` — human-readable mirror (includes the
  full structured brief AND `style_anchor` as a string for convenience)
- `{project_root}/project.json` — the master state. Update these fields:
  - `brief` — the full structured brief (theme, palette, manifest, …)
  - `style_anchor.text` — the 60–90-word block from Step 3 (canonical
    location every downstream skill reads)
  - `current_step: "brief_locked"`
  - `next_step: "/slot-step-02"`
  - `updated_at: <ISO timestamp>`

Update `~/.h5g-slot-active-project.json` to point here.

### Step 6 — Next step nudge

```
✓ Step 1 — Game Brief locked.
  Game        : Phoenix of Ardashir
  Mood        : mystical regal
  Style lock  : stylized semi-realistic slot game art
  Palette     : deep midnight indigo with antique gold and burning crimson
  Symbols     : 13 (3 special, 2 HP, 2 MP, 6 LP card royals)
  Saved to    : <project_root>/game_brief.json + project.json
  Folder: <project_root>
  Open:   file:///<project_root with / separators>

Next: run `/slot-step-02` to generate the master key art.
The approved key art becomes the visual style anchor for every later asset.

Type `/slot-` to see the full numbered workflow.
```

## Hard rules

- **Never** put internal GDD codenames anywhere creative-facing
- **Never** describe palette in hex — named colors only
- **Never** mix LP families
- **Style lock must be exactly one phrase**, not a list
- If the GDD is silent on a field, mark it `null` and surface it as an open question
