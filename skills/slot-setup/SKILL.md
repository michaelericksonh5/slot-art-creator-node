name: slot-setup
description: FIRST RUN — Configure the slot-art-creator-node plugin for use. Walks the user through getting Google Gemini, fal.ai, and/or OpenAI API keys and saving them to the correct location WITHOUT ever putting the keys in chat. The plugin supports two model families with independent keys — NB2 (Gemini/fal.ai, runs the 4 nb2_* tools) and gpt-image-2 (OpenAI, runs the 2 gpt2_* tools — gpt2_generate and gpt2_edit). Use this whenever a user has just installed the plugin, is hitting "no API key" errors, wants to add a new provider, change which provider runs, or is generally setting up for the first time. Also use it when the user says "set up my keys", "add my OpenAI key", "configure the plugin", "I need to add my API key", or similar. Run this BEFORE any /slot-step-* skill if keys aren't configured.

# Setup — API Keys & First-Run Configuration

This skill handles the one-time setup users need before any other skill in
the plugin works. It does **orientation and validation only** — it never
accepts API keys via chat. Keys go through safe channels (terminal scripts
with hidden input, or Cowork's built-in plugin settings UI).

## Why never accept keys in chat

API keys are credentials. Chat messages are persisted in conversation
transcripts, may be stored locally on disk, and may be visible to other
tools, processes, or backups. Treating an API key the same way you'd treat
a credit card means: never paste it in chat.

**If the user pastes a key in chat at any point during this skill, stop
and tell them:**

> "Please don't paste API keys in chat — they get saved in conversation
> history. Delete that message if you can, then use one of the safe entry
> methods below. Your keys are not yet saved to the plugin."

Then redirect them to the appropriate safe method.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Detect current state

Determine what's already configured:

**a) Where keys would live for this user:**
- Canonical `.env` file: `~/.h5g-slot-art-creator/.env`
  - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.h5g-slot-art-creator\.env`
  - Mac/Linux: `$HOME/.h5g-slot-art-creator/.env`

**b) Read the file if it exists.** Use the Read tool. Note which keys are
present (non-empty values for `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `FAL_KEY`, and/or
`OPENAI_API_KEY`).

**c) Detect which surface the user is on** (Claude Code or Cowork). Cowork
sessions can be inferred from environment cues or just asked. The
guidance differs between them.

### Step 2 — Branch on state

Two key families with independent requirements:

- **NB2 family** (the 4 `nb2_*` tools): needs `GEMINI_API_KEY` and/or
  `FAL_KEY`. Either alone is sufficient.
- **GPT Image 2 family** (the 2 `gpt2_*` tools — `gpt2_generate` and
  `gpt2_edit`): needs `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Optional — only required if the
  user wants to use gpt-image-2 for text rendering, stable-2K
  photorealism, or multi-image composition.

**State A — fully configured for both families:**
GEMINI and/or FAL set AND OPENAI set. Confirm everything's ready, skip
to Step 4 (validation).

**State B — NB2 ready, no OpenAI:**
The plugin's main NB2 workflow works. Ask the user if they want to add
OpenAI for the gpt-image-2 tools (worth it for paytables, logos,
text-heavy assets). If no, skip to Step 4.

**State C — OpenAI only, no NB2:**
gpt2_* tools work but nothing else does. Tell the user the NB2 tools
are disabled and ask if they want to add GEMINI_API_KEY or FAL_KEY.

**State D — nothing configured:**
Walk through all three. Continue to Step 3.

**State E — partial NB2 (one of Gemini/fal but not both):**
Tell the user what their current setup does, ask if they want to add
the other NB2 key for optimal routing AND/or add OpenAI for the
gpt2_* tools.

### Step 3 — Guide the user to set keys safely

State each provider once, with the link to get a key. Then give the user
the platform-specific safe entry instructions below.

> **API keys — two independent families:**
>
> **NB2 family** (powers the 4 `nb2_*` tools — generate / edit / upscale /
> smart_resize). Either alone is sufficient; both set gives optimal routing.
> - Google Gemini: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
> - fal.ai: https://fal.ai/dashboard
>
> **GPT Image 2 family** (powers `gpt2_generate` / `gpt2_edit`). Optional —
> set this if you want OpenAI's gpt-image-2 for paytables, logos, banners
> with text, stable-2K photorealism, or compositional multi-image edits.
> For genuine 4K, generate at 2K with gpt2 then upscale with `nb2_upscale`
> (that's a tested path). More expensive per call than NB2 — use selectively.
> - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
>
> See `shared/nb2_prompting.md` for the NB2 routing table and
> `shared/gpt_image2_prompting.md` for when to pick gpt-image-2 over NB2.

#### Claude Cowork users

Cowork has a built-in safe key entry UI. Walk them through it:

1. Open the **Claude Desktop** app
2. Switch to the **Cowork** tab
3. Click **Customize** in the sidebar > **Browse plugins**
4. Find **slot-art-creator-node** in the listing and click into it
5. In the plugin's settings, you'll see fields for `GEMINI_API_KEY` and
   `FAL_KEY`. **Paste your key(s) there — not in this chat.**
6. **Restart Claude Desktop once** so the MCP server picks up the new keys.
7. Come back to chat and say "done" (or "keys are set", or similar) — I'll
   verify everything works.

#### Claude Code users — double-click launcher (recommended)

Resolve the absolute path to the launcher script. The plugin lives in the
Claude Code plugin cache:

- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\plugins\cache\h5g-plugins\slot-art-creator-node\<version>\setup-keys.bat`
- Mac/Linux: `$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/h5g-plugins/slot-art-creator-node/<version>/setup-keys.sh`

Read the plugin manifest (`<install path>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) to
get the exact `<version>`. List the directory under
`~/.claude/plugins/cache/h5g-plugins/slot-art-creator-node/` if multiple
versions exist — pick the newest.

Print the exact path to the user with clear platform instructions:

**Windows:**
> 1. Open File Explorer
> 2. Paste this path into the address bar and press Enter:
>    `<absolute path to setup-keys.bat>`
> 3. A terminal window opens. Paste your key(s) when prompted — your input
>    is hidden, keys do not echo to the screen.
> 4. When it says "Setup complete," close that window and come back here.

**Mac / Linux:**
> 1. Open a Terminal
> 2. Paste this command and press Enter:
>    `bash '<absolute path to setup-keys.sh>'`
> 3. The script prompts you for each key — your input is hidden.
> 4. When done, come back here.

Once the user reports they've finished, continue to Step 4.

#### Claude Code users — manual fallback

If the launcher script doesn't run for any reason (Node missing,
permissions, etc.), the user can edit the `.env` file directly:

> 1. Create or open this file in any text editor:
>    `~/.h5g-slot-art-creator/.env`
>    (You may need to create the folder first.)
> 2. Add one or both lines (no quotes, no spaces around the `=`):
>    ```
>    GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...your-key-here
>    FAL_KEY=...your-key-here
>    ```
> 3. Save the file, then come back here.

### Step 4 — Validate

Once the user reports keys are set, verify the file looks right:

1. **Read** `~/.h5g-slot-art-creator/.env` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.h5g-slot-art-creator\.env`).
2. Confirm at least one of `GEMINI_API_KEY=` or `FAL_KEY=` is present and
   has a non-empty value after the `=` sign.
3. Do **NOT** print the key values back to the user (they'd end up in chat).
   Just confirm presence: "I see GEMINI_API_KEY is set" / "FAL_KEY is set"
   or "still empty."

If both are still empty after the user said "done," ask them where they
saved the keys — they may have edited the wrong file or used the wrong UI.

For Cowork users where keys live in the plugin's env-var UI (not in `.env`),
the file check won't apply. In that case, trust the user's confirmation and
move on; real validation happens on first MCP call.

### Step 5 — Confirm and route

Tell the user what they have and what's next. Examples:

**Full setup:**

> ✓ Setup complete.
>   Gemini  : set       (NB2 tools: enabled)
>   fal.ai  : set       (NB2 tools: enabled, smart_resize optimized)
>   OpenAI  : set       (gpt2_* tools: enabled)
>
> NB2 routes generate/edit/upscale to Gemini and smart_resize to fal.ai.
> gpt-image-2 is available via gpt2_generate / gpt2_edit for paytables,
> logos, text-heavy banners, and compositional edits.
>
> Next steps:
>   - If you have a Game Design Document: run `/slot-step-00`
>   - If you're pitching a fresh concept: run `/slot-step-01`
>   - For an overview of the workflow: run `/slot-help`

**NB2 only:**

> ✓ NB2 setup complete (Gemini and/or fal.ai). All 4 NB2 tools work.
>   gpt2_* tools are disabled — add OPENAI_API_KEY later if you want
>   gpt-image-2 for paytables, logos, or text-heavy assets.
>
> Next steps: `/slot-step-00`, `/slot-step-01`, or `/slot-help`.

**OpenAI only (rare):**

> ✓ gpt-image-2 setup complete. gpt2_generate and gpt2_edit are
>   available, but the NB2 tools (which power most of the slot-step-*
>   workflow) need GEMINI_API_KEY or FAL_KEY too.

## Hard rules

- **Never accept an API key value in chat.** If the user pastes one,
  refuse to use it and instruct them to delete the message and use a
  safe channel.
- **Never echo a key value back to the user.** Even partial values. Confirm
  presence only ("set" / "empty").
- **Never write a key value to any file the user can see in the chat
  output.** Only the canonical `.env` file, which the user manages.
- **Always tell the user where keys are saved** so they know how to update
  them later.

## What this skill does NOT do

- It does not store keys in the project's `project.json` (those are
  per-game; keys are per-user).
- It does not validate keys via real API calls — that would burn the
  user's quota for a setup check. Real validation happens implicitly on
  first generation. If the user wants a verification call, they can run
  `node setup-keys.js --check` from a terminal — that uses Gemini's
  cheapest endpoint.
- It does not handle multi-account scenarios (e.g. one Gemini key for
  prod, one for testing). Users with that requirement should set keys
  via shell env vars instead of `.env` so they can swap on the fly.
